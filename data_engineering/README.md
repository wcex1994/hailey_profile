## Data Engineering 

This section is mostly a summary of my study in Data Engineering at the UC Berkeley MIDS program. Content are enhanced based upon readings and individual projects. 

The course focuses on understanding the pipeline:

The components include:

* Sourcing
* Ingesting
* Transformation
* Storing 
* Querying

### Difference between Data Engineering and Data Science

* Data Science: Asking the right questions on any given datasets
* Data Engineer: Gathering and collecting the data, storing it, doing batch processing or real-time processing on it, and serving it via an API to a data scientist who can easily query it
