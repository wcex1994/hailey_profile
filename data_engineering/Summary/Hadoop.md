# Hadoop

## Why Distributed System

Volume of the data is increasing but the transfer (R/W speed) is not keeping up. We want to R/W in parallel to or from multiple tasks.

Working in parallel problems:

* Hardware failure: solution as replication
* Combine from multiple sources for analysis: MapReduce

Comparison with other data system:

## MapReduce

Map
    Scale out
