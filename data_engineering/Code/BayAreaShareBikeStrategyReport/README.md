## Bay Area Share Bike Strategy Report

The purpose of this report is to identify the best pricing strategy for more riderships in the Bay Area for Ford GoBike.

All analysis is based on the public dataset "San Francisco Ford GoBike Share" (https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/san-francisco-public-data/sf-bike-share?filter=category:public-safety). 

Due to the limited knowledge on the data collection process, the analysis will not have a thorough data cleansing procedure. Instead, all queries will have stricter filtering to eliminate unqualified data.

There are three options for pricing:

* A flat price for a single one-way trip
* A day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24 hours
* An annual membership

To identify the most suitable pricing deal, there are two questions to be answered:

* What are the 5 most popular trips as "commuter trips"?
* What are the recommendations for offers?

We will analyze the data structure, the difference between subscriber and customer, the common trips, the durations and also the time periods. At the end of the report, based on the analysis, it will give answers to the two questions above.
